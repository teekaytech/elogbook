                    The University of badan Electronic Logbook system allows students of this great citadel, who are on internship, to report their Industrial Training daily activities with ease. The former method of reporting activities of students is manual; which has many shortcomings, but the management has deemed it fit to automate the process to ease the tasks of the students, the staff, and the entire institution at large.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a norm, all internship students must report their daily activities in a logbook given to them at the commencement of their Industrial Training. This is to be checked and approved by their industrial-based and institution-based supervisors, as a way of monitoring and coordinating the programme.
                </p>
